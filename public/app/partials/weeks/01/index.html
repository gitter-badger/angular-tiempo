            <h1>Week One of Twelve</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>Let's beggin</h3>
        <p>
            The first thing that we need to do is a <strong><a href="http://bower.io/docs/config/">.bowerrc</a></strong> file:
        </p>
        <!-- .bowerrc -->
        <div hljs language="json" include="'public/app/partials/weeks/01/files/bowerrc'"></div>
        <p>
            Then whe are going to create a <strong>bower.json</strong> manifest file to get all the dependencies:
        </p>
        <!-- bower.json -->
        <div hljs language="json" include="'public/app/partials/weeks/01/files/bower.json'"></div>
        <p>
            Now we can "install" everything with Bower:
        </p>
        <!-- Bower install -->
        <div hljs language="bash" include="'public/app/partials/weeks/01/files/bower-install'"></div>
        <p>
            Now we have the <code class="badge">./public/app/vendors</code> directory with angular. Say goodbye to the manual download dependencies ;)
        </p>
        <h3>But i want a REST service like my grandpa</h3>
        <p>
            Restify is a small REST Framework that we are going to use for our small app.
        </p>
        <!-- Restify Module install -->
        <div hljs language="bash" include="'public/app/partials/weeks/01/files/restify-install'"></div>
        <p>
            A new <code class="badge">./node_modules</code> directory is created, this is where all our Nodejs modules are installed locally. So, to test if restify is ok, we are going to create a new javascript file:
        </p>
        <!--  -->
        <div hljs language="javascript" include="'public/app/partials/weeks/01/files/test.js'"></div>
        <p>Simple, right? Now we are able to run our little server with:</p>
        <div hljs language="bash">node test.js</div>
        <p>If you acces to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:2040">http://127.0.0.1:2040</a> then you will be able to see our first Hello World. <strong>Mission Accomplished!</strong></p>
        <p>Ok, but we need a better REST implementation, so we are going to do it right now:</p>
        <div hljs language="javascript" include="'public/app/partials/weeks/01/files/app.js'"></div>
        <p>Now let's create a simple html in the <code class="badge">./public</code> directory:</p>
        <div hljs include="'public/app/partials/weeks/01/files/index.html'" language="html"></div>
        <p>
            Now, if we go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8124/">http://127.0.0.1:8124</a>, then we can see our new Hello World. Perfect, now we have a simple REST server, let's code some simple Angular.js examples.

        <h3>Angular Expressions</h3>
        <p>
            Angular expressions are JavaScript-like code snippets that are usually placed in bindings such as {{ expression }}.
        </p>
        <div hljs include="'public/app/partials/weeks/01/files/expressions.html'" language="html"></div>
        <p>
            If we go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8124/week1/expressions.html">http://127.0.0.1:8124/week1/expressions.html</a> we are going to see the result of the expressions.
        </p>
        <h3>Angular Data Binding</h3>
        <p>
            Data-binding in Angular apps is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components. The way that Angular implements data-binding lets you treat the model as the single-source-of-truth in your application. The view is a projection of the model at all times. When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <div hljs include="'public/app/partials/weeks/01/files/binding.html'" language="html"></div>
        <p>You can now acces <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8124/week1/binding.html">http://127.0.0.1:8124/week1/binding.html</a> to see the power of binding in action.</p>
        <p>
            <h2>Result:</h2></p>
        <p>
            <input type="text" placeholder="Type your name :)" ng-model="name" /> => {{name}}</p>
        <p>Here we just added a <strong>ng-model</strong> and show his data with <code ng-non-bindable>{{name}}</code>. No listener in keystroke like jQuery, how about that?</p>
